# Enter the Rickiverse

Rick and Morty-themed webapp to demonstrate calling an api that fetches character data from a local server and dynamically populates the interface with information about each variety of Rick. 
The app allows users to select from a dropdown menu, view their details on the left and right side of the interface, and see the character's image in the center of the page. 
Users can also like a character, with the like count updating with each click. 

## Features:

    Dynamic Content Rendering:
        Utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve character data from a local server.
        Populates the UI with character information upon page load.

    Interactive Interface:
        Allows users to select a character from a dropdown menu to view their details.
        Clicking on a character's image dynamically updates the displayed information on the left and right side.

    Like Functionality:
        Users can click a "Like" button to increase the like count for a selected Rick.
        Updates the like count which persists via db.json.
        
## Usage:

 [Clone the repository](https://github.com/racosta323/the-rickiverse/)

    Run the frontend server using `npm start`; run the backend server using `npm run server`.

    Explore the dropdown menu to select a Rick and view their details.

    Click on a character's image in the grid to view their information.

    Use the "like button" a character to increase their like count.

## Implementation Details:

    Event listeners are used to handle interactions such as image clicks and dropdown changes.

    The app dynamically creates and updates HTML elements to display character information in a grid.

    Data is fetched from and updated on a local server using the Fetch API.

## Database Interaction:

    The app interacts with a local server (http://localhost:3000/results) to fetch and update character data.

    A PATCH request is used to update the like count for a specific character.
